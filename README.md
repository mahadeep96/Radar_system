Radar System Project README
Introduction
Welcome to the Radar System project! This project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller along with an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to create a radar-like system that can detect objects in its path.
The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor to rotate it, allowing it to scan its surroundings and detect obstacles.

Components
To build this project, you will need the following components:

Arduino Uno microcontroller
Ultrasonic sensor (such as HC-SR04)
Servo motor (such as SG90)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
Power source (USB cable or external power supply for the Arduino)
Setup
Follow these steps to set up the Radar System:

Mounting: Mount the ultrasonic sensor on the servo motor. Ensure that the sensor has a clear line of sight to scan its surroundings.
Wiring: Connect the components as follows:
Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
Connect the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino.
Connect the Trig pin of the ultrasonic sensor to a digital pin (e.g., pin 11) of the Arduino.
Connect the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to another digital pin (e.g., pin 12) of the Arduino.
Connect the signal (control) pin of the servo motor to a PWM pin (e.g., pin 9) of the Arduino.
Connect the VCC and GND pins of the servo motor to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively.
Code: Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino Uno board.
Power: Power the Arduino Uno using a USB cable or an external power supply.
Usage
Once the setup is complete and the code is uploaded to the Arduino, the Radar System will start working. The servo motor will rotate the ultrasonic sensor, scanning the area in front of it.
The ultrasonic sensor will emit sound waves and measure the time it takes for them to bounce back. Based on this information, it will detect objects in its path.

Customization
Feel free to customize the project according to your requirements:

Adjust the rotation speed and range of the servo motor.
Modify the detection threshold and sensitivity of the ultrasonic sensor.
Add additional sensors or components for advanced functionality.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the Radar System, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Double-check the wiring connections to ensure they are correct.
Verify that the Arduino sketch is uploaded successfully and without errors.
Ensure that the power supply to the Arduino is stable and sufficient.
Check for any physical obstructions or interferences that may affect the performance of the ultrasonic sensor.
